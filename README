GPG Explorer Extensions
=======================

This package contains GpgEX, the GNU Privacy Guard extensions for the
Windows Explorer shell.


Registry Settings
=================

The following registry entries are set by GpgEX at installation time
to register it as a shell extension:

HKCR\CLSID\CCD955E4-5C16-4A33-AFDA-A8947A94946B
HKCR\*\ShellEx\ContextMenuHandlers\GpgEX
HKCR\Directory\ShellEx\ContextMenuHandlers\GpgEX

The following registry entries are read by GpgEX and affect its
operation:

HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:GpgEX Debug File
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\GNU\GnuPG:GpgEX Debug File
  See below.

HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:UI Server
HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:UI Server
HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Install Directory
HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Install Directory
  These entries are not anymore used.



Debugging
=========

A debug file path can be specified with the registry value "GpgEX
Debug File" in the HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG key.  To this file logging
information is appended.

To increase the frequency at which extensions are unloaded, create the
following registry key with default value "1".

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AlwaysUnloadDLL

On NT, you can run the taskbar, the Desktop and each explorer window
in a separate process by creating a DWORD "DesktopProcess" with value
1 under:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

You can also terminate the explorer process and restart it from a
previously opened console window.
