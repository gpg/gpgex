GPG Explorer Extensions
=======================

This package contains GpgEX, the GNU Privacy Guard extensions for the
Windows Explorer shell.


Registry Settings
=================

The following registry entries are read by GpgEX and affect its
operation:

HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:UI Server
HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:UI Server
  The path to the executable binary of the UI server, relative to
  INSTDIR.  Absolute paths are currently not supported.  It defaults
  to the empty sting, so that the UI server is expected in INSTDIR.
  If the configure option --enable-gpa-only is used these registry
  entries have no effect.

HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Install Directory
HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Install Directory
  The directory where GnuPG is installed.  This is set by the GnuPG or
  Gpg4win installer and used to locate the gpgconf.exe binary.  If
  this is not set that binary is searched starting at the installation
  directory of gpgex.dll in this order:
    .\gpgconf.exe
    ..\bin\gpgconf.exe
    ..\GnuPG\\bin\\gpgconf.exe
    ..\..\GnuPG\bin\gpgconf.exe

HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG:GpgEX Debug File
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\GNU\GnuPG:GpgEX Debug File
  See below.

The following registry entries are set by GpgEX at installation time
to register it as a shell extension:

HKCR\CLSID\CCD955E4-5C16-4A33-AFDA-A8947A94946B
HKCR\*\ShellEx\ContextMenuHandlers\GpgEX
HKCR\Directory\ShellEx\ContextMenuHandlers\GpgEX


Debugging
=========

A debug file path can be specified with the registry value "GpgEX
Debug File" in the HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG key.  To this file logging
information is appended.  The above key is used for the legacy 32 bit
version of Windows.  For the current 64 bit version the key is
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\GNU\GnuPG - and yes, this is twisted but we
won't change it anymore.

To increase the frequency at which extensions are unloaded, create the
following registry key with default value "1".

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AlwaysUnloadDLL

On NT, you can run the taskbar, the Desktop and each explorer window
in a separate process by creating a DWORD "DesktopProcess" with value
1 under:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

You can also terminate the explorer process and restart it from a
previously opened console window.
